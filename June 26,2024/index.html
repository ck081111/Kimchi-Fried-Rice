    <H3>Required Ingredients:</H3>
    <!-- Ingredient List -->
    <div class="Ingredients">
        <li>150 g pork or other meats, very thinly sliced (I used pork jowl pre-sliced for hot pot)</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp soy sauce (Korean or Japanese)</li>
        <li>½ - ⅔ cup kimchi, packed, with juice, plus extra for serving on the side (see note)</li>
        <li>350g cooked short grain white rice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup long beans or other crunchy veg, cut into ¼-inch pieces</li>
        <li> 1 rounded tablespoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste.</li>
        <li> 1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
        <li> 2 tsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
        <li> 2 Fried eggs</li>
        <li> Optional: Chopped green onions for garnish</li>
        <li> Note: When I take the kimchi out of the jar, I scoop out an extra tablespoon or so of the juice along with it. </li>
        <li> If your kimchi is juicier (has a lot of liquid), you can add more juice for stronger flavour. </li>

<!-- Instructions List: -->
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<div class="Instructions">
<li>1. Marinade the pork or whatever protein you are using with 1½ teaspoon soy sauce, set aside while you prep other ingredients.</li>
<li>2. Place the kimchi in a strainer and press out as much juice as you can from the kimchi and reserve the juice.
     Chop the kimchi into small fried-rice friendly pieces.</li>
<li>3. Combine the reserved kimchi juice, gochujang, sesame oiland 1 teaspoon of the soy sauce; 
    whisk until the gochujang is dissolved.</li>
<li>4. Right before you make the fried rice, fry some sunny-side up eggs (or however you like your eggs)
     and set them aside in a warm place.</li>
<li>5. In a wok, heat about 1 tablespoon of a neutral flavoured oil over medium heat then add the kimchi.
     Fry the kimchi for 2 minutes or until it is dry and starts to brown slightly.</li>
<li>6. Add the pork and stir-fry until it is 80% done.</li>
<li>7. Add the long beans and toss to combine.</li>
<li>8. Add the rice, then pour the sauce and sprinkle the sugar over the rice. 
    Turn the heat to high and toss until the rice is evenly coated in the sauce, pressing down on any rice lumps to break the grains apart.</li>
<li>9. Once the rice is thoroughly coated in the sauce, if you want, you can let the rice sit on the heat without stirring for 30 seconds or so until it toasts a little on the bottom.  
    Taste and add more of the soy sauce as needed. Plate. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Top with fried egg. Enjoy!</li>
